1/2 whole pineapple, cut into spears and skewered
2C white rice (cooked)
6 whole pork chops
1T butter
1T vegetable oil
1 large, sweet onion (sliced)
6T soy sauce (more to taste or if more liquid is needed)
Another 2T soy sauce
1T rice wine vinegar
2T honey
1T Sriracha
Salt to taste
3 cloves minced garlic
2 eggs
1 small jar (drained) pimentos
1-1/2C frozen peas

Instructions:
Cook rice.

Grill or sauté pineapple spears until they have good marks/color on the outside. Slice, set aside.

Heat butter and oil over medium high heat, add pork chops to the pan. Sauté on both sides until they have nice color.

Throw in the sliced onions and work them into the crevices between the chops. Shake the pan and move the onions around and let them cook for a couple of minutes.

When the onions are starting to soften, add soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, honey, and hot sauce. Shake the pan, stir it around, and let it cook and bubble up for a couple of minutes until the pork chops are completely cooked and the sauce is thicker.

Remove the pork chops to a bowl and let the sauce bubble up and cook for another 30-45 seconds (to thicken). Pour it over the pork chops. Set aside.

Add a small amount of oil to the same pan (without cleaning it) and return it to the stovetop over medium-high heat.

Add garlic and stir it around. Crack in eggs and immediately stir them to rough scramble them. Add peas, pimentos, and a couple of tablespoons (additional) soy sauce. Add cooked rice and stir it around to cook for a couple of minutes.

To serve, pile rice on a plate, then top with a pork chops and onions from the sauce. Drizzle a little bit of sauce over the top.
