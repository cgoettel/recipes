#Soft and chewy peanut butter cookies

##Ingredients
- &frac12; cup butter, softened
- 1 cup peanut butter
- &frac34; cup white sugar
- &frac12; cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 &frac14; cup all-purpose flour
- &frac34; teaspoon baking soda
- &frac12; teaspoon baking powder
- &frac14; teaspoon salt

##Directions
Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.

Beat butter and peanut butter together until well combined. Add sugars and beat until fluffy. Add
egg, milk, and vanilla extract and mix until smooth. Add baking soda, baking powder, and
salt and mix just until blended. Beat in flour until combined.

Roll balls of dough in white sugar before placing on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350&deg;F for 10&ndash;12&nbsp;minutes. Do not over bake; they're better softer. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for at least 3&nbsp;minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
