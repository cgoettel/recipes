#Dutch oven egg souffl&eacute;

##Ingredients
- Charcoal, about 26 briquettes
- 1 dozen eggs
- 1 C milk
- 1&ndash;1&frac12; lbs sausage
- Cheese
- 6&ndash;8 slices bread, ripped into bite size pieces

##Directions
- Heat charcoal.
- In a separate bowl, beat eggs and milk.
- Once heated, place 12" Dutch oven on top of all the coals.
- Cook sausage until almost done. Should still be just barely raw (it will finish cooking with the rest).
- Remove from heat.
- Add eggs and bread.
- Push the bread into the eggs so they're covered. Top with cheese.
- Cook for 20-22&nbsp;min with 13 coals top, 13 coals bottom. Maybe one less on the bottom so it doesn't char.
- Depending on the amount of eggs used (can easily be done with 13&ndash;14&nbsp;eggs without really changing anything) it can take another few minutes. Just cut through to make sure it's fully cooked.
- Salt and pepper to taste.

Serves 6&ndash;8&nbsp;people.

This recipe can be easily changed to include more eggs, sausage, and bread. Also, a little dry mustard powder and hot sauce in the eggs adds a nice flavor. Adding more ingredients will change the cooking time and possibly the amount of briquettes used. Use good judgment. And probably use a larger Dutch oven (I found that this recipe, as stated, completely fills a 10" when cooked).
