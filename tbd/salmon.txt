grilled salmon

1/2 cube real butter melted
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 clove fresh minced garlic
1 teaspoon dill weed
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
1-2 salmon fillets
1 pre-soaked cedar board

Mix all ingredients except salmon fillets. Let stand, stirring occasionally. Mixture should become kind of gelled. Brush or pour on salmon fillets. (Save about 1 1/2 Tablespoons if you're making the rice to help season it.) Cook over grill on pre-soaked (at least one hour) cedar boards on the grill or in oven until the salmon flakes and is done.
 
Cedar boards are available at Sportsman's Warehouse or probably Cabelas.  If you can't find one, you can grill it on Aluminum foil, skin side down.  Sometimes, I use 1/2 the butter for a more intense flavor.  Also, here's the instructions for making the rice, if you're interested.
 
Melt 1/2 cube butter in saucepan.  Add 2 minced cloves garlic and 1 medium onion.  Cook until onion is tender.  Add 2 cups rice and stir, until some of the rice grains start to brown.  Add 4 chicken buillion cubes, 1 tsp salt, and 4 cups of water.  Bring to a boil.  Stir until cubes are dissolved.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the prepared salmon seasoning sauce.  Turn heat to ultra low and cover and cook 20 minutes.  Serve.
