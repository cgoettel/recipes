12 oz cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 t. dill weed
1/4 t. ground cracked pepper
1 bunch green onions, sliced, green included
1/4 cup + Real Hormel Bacon Pieces

Cream cheese, mayonnaise and seasonings until smooth.  Blend in green onions and bacon.  

Create balls according to desired size.  Place on plate and cover with sarah wrap.  Refrigerator to firm stage.  Reshape and roll in chopped pecans, walnuts or almonds.  I prefer pecans.  This recipe will make three good size cheeseballs or use ice cream scoop for smaller gift version.
