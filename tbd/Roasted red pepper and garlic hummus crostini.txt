Makes 4 cups.

1 baguette
2T olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
4T freshly squeezed lime juice
2/3C tahini
2/3C water
4C canned chickpeas, drained (reserve 1/4 cup liquid)
1 whole roasted red pepper, finely diced, divided
1T ground cumin
Kosher salt and fresh black pepper, to taste
Cucumber, thinly sliced on the diagonal

Slice the bread 1/4-inch thick, on the diagonal, and place slices on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast under the broiler or on a grill until very lightly browned on both sides. Brush the tops with olive oil. Set aside.

Process the garlic, lime juice and tahini until it turns into a smooth paste. Add the water, chickpeas, and half of the red pepper, and continue to process until mixture is almost fluffy. Add some of the reserved chickpea liquid if necessary to achieve a light, spreadable consistency. Season with the cumin. Transfer to a bowl.

Stir the rest of the diced red pepper into the hummus.

Spread hummus on each of the toasted bread slices, and top each with a slice of cucumber, if desired.
