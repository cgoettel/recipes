1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
250g walnuts
1 clove of garlic
30g pine nuts
40g parmiggiano-reggiano (I'll get that)
250ml milk
1 sprig of marjoram
40g bread
Salt to taste

Soak the walnuts in boiling water for 5 minutes then drain.  Soak bread in milk.  Once the bread has soaked up all the milk it can hold, separate the bread and remaining milk.  Split the two lobes of the walnuts and add them to a food processor or blender.  Also add the pine nuts, garlic, parmiggiano, and oil.  Then add the bread and marjoram.  Begin to blend the contents while slowly adding the milk.  Only add enough so that the mixture reaches a creamy texture.  (In our case, a little chunky wouldn't be too bad)  Add salt to taste and once you've reached the desired texture, the sauce is ready for use.
