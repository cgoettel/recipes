4 C sifted (that's the key) all-purpose flour
1/2 t. salt
1 t. baking powder
1 C (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
2 C sugar
2 large eggs
2 t. pure vanilla or 2 t. fresh lemon juice and zest of 2 lemons

In a large bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking powder.  Set aside.

Use an electric mixer to cream butter and sugar until fluffy.  Beat in eggs.

Add flour mixture, a little at a time, and mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.  Stir in vanilla or lemon juice and zest. 

Divide dough into thirds and flatten like a disc.  Wrap dough in plastic wrap; chil for about 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/8" thick.  Cut into disired shapes.  Transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Refrigerate uncooked cookies for 15 minutes.  Bake until edges just start to brown about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on wire racks; decorate as desired.
