Fill these triangular treats with homemade or store-bought fillings. You can also use thick preserves or canned poppy seed filling.

## Ingredients
- Basic oil dough (recipe below)
- Filling (recipe below)
- 1 egg yolk beaten with 2 tsp water

## Directions:
- Prepare dough and desired filling as directed. (Can be prepared in advance and refrigerated or frozen.)
- Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.
- Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Flour each piece of dough lightly. Roll out on a floured surface to &frac14;" thickness. Cut into 3" circles, using a round cookie cutter or a small juice glass.
- Place a spoonful of filling on each circle. Bring up 3 sides to meet, then pinch edges of dough together to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
- Place on sprayed foil-lined cookie sheets. Brush with egg glaze.
- Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden.
