4 medium-sized tomatoes (1 1/2 pounds)
1 medium white onion, peeled and halved
3 jalapenos, trimmed
4 garlic cloves, unpeeled
Juice of 2 limes
1 1/2 t kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/4 t freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1/4 C fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

Heat broiler with rack in top position. Place the tomatoes, onion, jalapenos and garlic in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil for 6-8 minutes or until the vegetables are blistered and slightly softened, rotating sheet and flipping vegetables frequently. (Remove garlic earlier if browning too quickly).

Discard garlic skins. In a good processor pulse garlic and vegetables until coarsely pureed. Add the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Pulse to combine.

Transfer salsa to a bowl and stir in cilantro.

Salsa will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
