1 large can tomato juice
3/4 tomato juice can of water
el pato sauce -- 1/3 can (mom) or more (everyone else)
1 T granulated garlic powder
1 T salt
1/4 t (or +) ground pepper
2-3 T chili powder

Bring all ingredients to a boil. Thicken with mixture of 1 1/2 C cold water and 1/2 C to 1 C flour. Whisk the thickening mixture really good now, y'hear -- you add the flour to the cold water, not vice versa. Pour through a sieve into the boiling mixture and stir constantly until you get the desired thickness. Turn down to low and simmer. I keep it only low while making the enchiladas.  Nothing worse then cold sauce. Nothing. Not even the Holocaust. Trust me.

If sauce gets too thick, thin with water.  Be careful, it thins quickly.
