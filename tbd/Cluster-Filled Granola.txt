1lb oats
3C coarsely chopped raw nuts and/or seeds
1t ground cinnamon
1/2t ground cardamom
1/2t ground nutmeg
1C packed dark brown sugar
1/2C (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/3C water
1/2t kosher salt
2t vanilla extract
2C dried fruit

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Grind half the oats to a fine powder. In a large bowl, combine the whole oats, ground oats, nuts, and spices. In a microwave-safe bowl (or in a saucepan over medium heat), combine the brown sugar, butter and water and heat just until the butter has melted and the mixture is bubbly. Stir the mixture together until smooth, then stir in the salt and vanilla. Pour this mixture over the oats and nuts, stirring well to coat -- it should be uniformly moist. Stir in another tablespoon or two of water if it isn't. Let stand for about ten minutes.

Spread the mixture out on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper, separating it into irregular clumps with your fingers, and allowing space between the clumps for the hot air to circulate. Slide into the middle of the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and stir, gently breaking up the mixture into small-to-medium sized clumps. Return to the oven and bake another 15 minutes or so before stirring again. Repeat the bake-and-stir until the mixture is a uniform golden brown and completely dry; this usually takes 1-1 1/2 hours. Cool completely, then stir in any dried fruit you want to use.
