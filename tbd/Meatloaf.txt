hamburger
diced onion
1 egg
1/2 cup or so of sour cream
1/2 - 1 cup oatmeal
salt and pepper
Catsup

mix all together, place in greased loaf pan.  Pour a thin layer of catsup over the top and cover.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Remove foil and continue baking for 1/2 hour.  If you want a baked potato, put it in with the meatloaf in the beginning.

It all depends upon how big of a loaf you want.  If you want a small loaf use a half of a pound of hamburger and a half of an onion and cut the sour cream and oatmeal in half of what I said.  If you want a full loaf, use a pound of hamburger and a whole onion.  You'll still need one egg for both.  Small loaf, probably 1/4 cup of catsup; large loaf a half of a cup.  

The sour cream keeps it moist, the oatmeal gives it bulk, the catsup flavor.  Some people add a little brown sugar to the catsup on top with Worcestershire for a tangy bbq taste if you want that.

I use to love meatloaf sandwiches and still do but it seems like a lot of the times I make meat loaf, if gets thrown away so I'd make a smaller loaf.  You can also make the bigger batch, split it in half, cook one and freeze the other.  It freezes well.
