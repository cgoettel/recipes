Paul Stainton yeah mate i usually use 3 eggs, half a pint of milk and as much flour as i need till it feels right. grease up the pans with lard and heat pans for 2 mins in a very hot oven before pouring the batter in

Paul Stainton I don't know about crepes. Its not too thin just getting slightly thick. Try a couple. Or you could look up an actual weight of flour on the internet.
