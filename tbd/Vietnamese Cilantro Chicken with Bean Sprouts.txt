(Inspired by Saigon Garden in Ann Arbor)

Ingredients:
1-2 T sesame oil
1 T Ginger, minced
chicken breast
3/4 C fresh bean sprouts, per person
~1/2 C cilantro leaves, per person
soy sauce (to taste)
Cock sauce (to taste)
1 C rice, per person

Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok until hot but not smoking. Add ginger and toast until starting to brown. Add chicken and saute until mostly cooked. Add soy sauce and cock sauce and stir in until chicken is evenly covered. Add bean sprouts and cilantro and stir together until cilantro leaves are wilted and bean sprouts soften, just a minute or so but not too much or else it'll turn into a mushy mess. Serve quickly over the rice.
