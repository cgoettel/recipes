1 1/2 doz. tomatilloes, husks removed
3 jalapenos
1-2 whole cloves of garlic
1 onion
1 tsp. salt
Guacamole
Sugar
 
Place the tomatilloes and jalapenos in a pan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and turn heat down a bit and cook for about 20 minutes or until the tomatilloes have turned brown and softened.
 
Remove from stove and drain the liquid reserving all goodies in the water.  Place in a blender and add the garlic cloves, onion and salt.  Blend well.
 
Take sauce and cool (in freezer for a few minutes, if you're in a hurry) or in refrigerator.  Then add guacamole to thicken and sugar to sweeten.
